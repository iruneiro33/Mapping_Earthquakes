# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this challenge is to project earthquake visualizations, with the use of the Mapbox API.

The layers used were:

a. Tectonic Plate Data
Map the tectonic plates border around the world marking the divisions in the red lines.

b. Major Earthquake Data
A second layer of data of major earthwuakes ranging of magnitude above 4.5. Also, another layer of information was added with data from milder earthquakes, or less than 4.5 in the scale.

c. Additional Map
Different maps like satellite view, Navigation night view (dark mode), or street mode are available in the page design able to be turned off or on as desired allowing interactivity.

In case something might not work here are some examples:
